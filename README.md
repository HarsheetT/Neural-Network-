## Day 1 - Building The Neuron
<p>
Today, we explored the building block of neural networks - the neuron!

<br>

#### Neurons 101:

They receive inputs (numbers) with associated weights (importance).
A bias acts like a constant nudge.
All these are combined and sent through an activation function to create the output.

<br> 

#### Learning with Weights & Biases:

By adjusting weights & biases, we change how the neuron reacts to inputs.
This allows the network to learn and produce the desired outputs over time.

<br>

#### In short: We control the neuron's output by playing with its internal settings! Ô∏è
