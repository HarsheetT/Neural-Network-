## Day 1 - Building The Neuron
<p>
Today, we explored the building block of neural networks - the neuron!

<br>

#### Neurons 101:

They receive inputs (numbers) with associated weights (importance).
A bias acts like a constant nudge.
All these are combined and sent through an activation function to create the output.
<br> 

#### Learning with Weights & Biases:

By adjusting weights & biases, we change how the neuron reacts to inputs.
This allows the network to learn and produce the desired outputs over time.
<br>

#### In short: We control the neuron's output by playing with its internal settings! Ô∏è

## Day 2 - Building a Neuron with NumPy and Class
<p>
Yesterday, we explored the inner workings of a neuron. Today, we'll see how to code it efficiently using Python's NumPy library and create a class to organize the neuron's components.
<br>

#### Simplifying with NumPy:
We'll use numpy.dot() to perform the weighted sum of inputs and biases in a single line, making the code cleaner and faster.
<br>

#### Creating a Neuron Class:
We'll define a Python class to encapsulate the neuron's weights, biases, and functionality. This class will include a forward method that calculates the neuron's output based on the input it receives.
<br>

By combining NumPy and a class, we'll create a more organized and efficient representation of a neuron, paving the way for building neural networks!
